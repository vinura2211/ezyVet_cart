# ezyVet_cart
My PHP code for a shopping cart for the ezyVet assignment

How to run the PHP file:
	1. Make sure you have a text editor to write the code (You can use notepad which is already on the computer, however I used Atom text editor).
	2. Download PHP from the internet (I used PHP version 7.4.9).
	3. Unzip the downloaded PHP file to a location that is easy to find (I used C:\php).
	4. Create an environment path to the PHP file. Do this by:
		1. Open the start menu and type "environment" and open the option.
		2. Click "Environment Variables" option in the bottom right.
		3. Click on "Path" line and click edit.
		4. Click "new" and write the file path to the PHP file (For me it was "C:\php").
		5. Click "OK" for all the opened tabs.
	5. Open command prompt by searching "cmd" in the start menu and check the file path next to where you need to type. 
	6. Create a folder in that location (I created a file called "www").
	7. Save the PHP file in that folder.
	8. In command prompt create a PHP server to run the PHP file in your browser by writing "php -S localhost:4000".
	9. Open your browser and in the address bar type "localhost:4000" followed by your folder name and the file name (For me it was "localhost:4000/www/cart.php").
	10. You should now see the webpage on your browser.
	
How to interact with the webpage:
	1. Under the required product write the required amount of that product in the textbox and click "Add to Cart".
	2. If you would like to change the amount you want of that product simply repeat the process above by writing the required amount and clicking "Add to Cart".
	3. If you would like to remove that product from your cart then click the "Remove" option next to the product.
	
The process I took to complete this assignment:
	When starting this assignment I had no knowledge of HTML or PHP so the first step was to learn the basics of both. I also needed to download PHP and follow the steps above to be able to run the code. After learning the basics, I searched for code and tutorials that is similar to what I required and adapted this to my requirements. This was a lengthy process as it required much trial and error.
